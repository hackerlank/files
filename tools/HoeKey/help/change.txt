Version .next:

    1.18: (just the exe is available for now.)
        New function: ClickThrough - make clicks go through a window (handy with always on top + transparency)
        Fix %c to get curdir from windows explorer for Windows 7 (and maybe Vista...)
        Fix %c to get curdir from current process. this will only work for 32 bit apps now :( 
    1.16: (just the exe is available for now.)
        New function: WaveVolume - Set wave volume instead of master volume
        New function: Clip - copy text to clipboard
        %p = current clipboard as plaintext (useful in keys function)
        %P = current clipboard as plaintext, removing returns/newlines
        Color remarks in hoekey list (tell me if you don't like this)
        Removed: stack/unstack/cycle functions - email me if you use these and i'll put them back
        Fix for keys from clipboard with backslashes (what?!) 
    1.15:
        Added keys: \f for page up, \g for page down
        %s gets filenames too (so you can highlight something in explorer, then edit it with "run|notepad %s"
        Add ability to specify hex for parameters (specify like 0xFEED, negatives like -0xFEED)
        Add color keying to transparency, e.g. ~t=Transparency||50|0xFF0000 ; pure red is transparent
        Volume sets master volume instead of wave - please email me if you don't like this :)
        Fix so volume can go to 100%
